                <p>If you feel that energy production in our country needs to be cleaner and more environmentally conscious, then direct action is necessary. Talk to your government representatives and ask that they support bills in favor of cleaner energy sources, like nuclear, solar and wind.</p>

                <p>If your representatives aren't inclined to support such action, then vote for officials that are more inline with your values. Elections are the primary method of changing our country and its ways.</p>
