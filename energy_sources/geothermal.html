                            <h2>Basics of Geothermal Power</h2>
                            <p>Geothhermal energyis heat that originates from the crust of the Earth. It is produced by plate tectonics, radioactive decay and the heat of the planet's formation. Geothermal power typically comes from steam turbines that are heated by the high temperatures of the Earth's core-mantle boundary.</p>

                            <p>The water is typically not in contact with the Earth or the molten rock that heats it. Geothermal power systems use subterranean pipes to move the cold water into the heated area to superheat it. Once the water is hot enough, it flashes into steam and is directed into turbine generators; much like that heated water and steam in a  nuclear reactor. When the steam has been moved through the turbine, it is returned to its liquid state by a cooling tower and recirculated through the system.</p>
                                
                            <p>Some geothermal power facilities inject water directly into the capture area and retrieve it at another point. The two types of systems are essentially the same, but an injected water system must screen the water for rocks and other debris, before circulating it through the turbines. The capture area may be a heated aquifer or a hotspring, but can also be a void in the Earth's crust.</p>

                            <h2>Geothermal Heating</h2>
                            <p>Geothermal heating, while similar in concept to geothermal power generation, is a different process altogether. Instead of circulating water and steam through the ground and turbine generators, geothermal heating is a closed system that continuously reirculates the same water. Such systems don't reach temperatures capable of vaporizing water, because they are built at much shallower depths than a gethermal power facility.</p>

                            <p>Geothermal heating and geothermal power are both safe, effective and ecologically sound methods for power generation and climate control within human structures. They produce no emissions, and require no fuel.</p>
